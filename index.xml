      <description>We sat on the bench just outside Chiesa Madre del Santissimo Salvatore. They put the plastic chairs in front of the church. The service is scheduled to be outdoors. Probably for the next years to come. The orchestra was practicing while the crowd gathered. The nun has read something, the people occasionally repeated “Amen” or sang “Hallelujah”. Then the padre took a speech. As we know not a word in Italian we didn’t get a clue what the padre has spoken about.</description>
