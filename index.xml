      <description>We parked at Corsa Roma half of mile away from La Fontane Greca. It was an exceptionally hot day. Everything around was closed. One or one and a half hours till the end of siesta. We decided to take a look at the sea. Regretted it immediately. The heat was unbearable, no surprises that the Italians prefer to sit this time out. To cool it down we got the ice and beverages at Bar Fontana Greca.</description>

      <description>We sat on the bench just outside Chiesa Madre del Santissimo Salvatore. They put the plastic chairs in front of the church. The service is scheduled to be outdoors. Probably for the next years to come. The orchestra was practicing while the crowd gathered. The nun has read something, the people occasionally repeated “Amen” or sang “Hallelujah”. Then the padre took a speech. As we know not a word in Italian we didn’t get a clue what the padre has spoken about.</description>
